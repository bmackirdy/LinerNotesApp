# Liner Notes

A clean, distraction-free web app for vinyl record collectors to catalog, organize, and share their physical collections.

Liner Notes helps vinyl collectors catalog, maintain, and share their record collections, track condition and updates, build wish lists, and connect with fellow enthusiasts.

## Tech Stack
- React (Vite) PWA client in `client/`
- Express API in `api/`
- Supabase for auth and database
- Documentation in `docs/`

## Repository Layout
- `client/` — React PWA (local dev with Vite)
- `api/` — Express API (local dev with Node)
- `supabase/` — SQL migrations and seeds
- `docs/` — PRD, sitemap, OpenAPI, deployment notes

## Getting Started (coming soon)
Setup scripts and instructions will be added after scaffolding the client, API, and Supabase project.
